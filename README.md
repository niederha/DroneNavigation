# DroneNavigation
This repo contains a prototype app that can be used to have a Parrot drone take off, go to specific GPS coordinates and land. 

The app requires you to connect to the drone via wifi. The aim of this project was to sort the navigation part for a larger app that can be found on https://github.com/niederha/Drone_to_hand_delivery.

The app was designed to be used with the Parrot drone BEBOP2 using the parrot SDK https://developer.parrot.com/docs/SDK3/. 

This project not being maintained anymore and the SDK still being in developpement caution is advised when testing the app with a real drone. Also be sure to comply with local regulations before flyong the drone.
